# Spring Web Authentication

This repository demonstrates how to implement authentication in a Spring Boot web application using Spring Security.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization with Spring Security  
- Custom login and logout functionality  
- Role-based access control  
- Secure password handling  
- Session management  
- Integration with a database for user credentials  

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** – For building the web application  
- **Spring Security** – For authentication and authorization  
- **Hibernate & JPA** – For database interaction  
- **MySQL** – As the database (configurable)    
- **Maven** – For dependency management  

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stakerAchyut/SpringWebAuth.git
   cd SpringWebAuth
2. Configure the database in application.properties:
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
   spring.datasource.username=sa
   spring.datasource.password=
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver
   spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
(Modify for MySQL or other databases as needed.)

3. Build and run the application:
   mvn spring-boot:run
